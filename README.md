<h1>C program code refers to source code written in the C programming language. C is a procedural, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It was initially designed for developing the UNIX operating system and remains widely used today for system-level software, embedded systems, and various applications requiring efficiency and low-level control.</h1> 
<h2>Key characteristics of C program code include:</h2>
<h1>Procedural Structure:</h1>
C programs are organized into functions, which are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. The execution flow follows a sequential, step-by-step procedure.
Low-Level Access:
C provides direct access to memory and hardware, enabling efficient resource management and system-level programming.
Compilation:
C source code is compiled into machine code before execution, resulting in fast and efficient programs.
Portability:
C programs written on one platform can generally be compiled and executed on other operating systems with minimal modifications, due to the language's standardization.
Syntax:
C code utilizes a relatively small set of keywords, control flow constructs (e.g., if, for, while, switch), and various operators (arithmetic, bitwise, logic). Statements are terminated by semicolons, and curly braces group statements into blocks.
Memory Management:
C requires manual memory management, where programmers are responsible for allocating and deallocating memory using functions like malloc() and free().
Absence of OOP Features:
Unlike object-oriented languages like C++ or Java, C does not inherently support features such as classes, objects, inheritance, or polymorphism.
